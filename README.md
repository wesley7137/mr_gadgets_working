The goal of this project is to develop a voice assistant application that integrates speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and WebSocket communication to interact with a large language model (LLM) for real-time query processing. The application is designed to function on mobile devices and smartwatches, providing a seamless user interface for continuous interaction and response.

Accomplishments

1. Backend Development
   WebSocket Server Implementation:

A FastAPI-based WebSocket server (server.py) that manages connections, receives audio and text data, and sends responses from the LLM.
Integrated with interpreter for processing user queries and generating responses.
STT and TTS Integration:

Implemented STT using a Transformer-based speech recognition model (stt.py).
Integrated TTS using a neural text-to-speech model (tts.py) to convert text responses back into audio for playback. 2. Frontend Development
Mobile Application:

Developed a React Native application (App.js) that connects to the WebSocket server.
The app can capture audio, send it to the server, receive responses, and play them back.
Includes functionality for capturing and sending screenshots for additional context.
UI/UX Enhancements:

Added visual feedback for different states: listening, processing, and playback.
Implemented silence detection to automatically stop listening after a period of inactivity.
Integrated the capability to capture and send screenshots for visual context. 3. Automation and Deployment
Batch Script:
Created a batch script (start_all.bat) to streamline the startup process for the backend server, LLM model, and frontend application.
Ensures all necessary components are launched in separate CLI windows, making it easy to start the application with a single command.
Current Status

1. Functional Features
   WebSocket Communication:

The WebSocket server is operational, handling connections, and exchanging data between the client and the backend effectively.
Speech Processing:

STT and TTS functionalities are integrated and operational, enabling conversion between audio and text.
UI and Interaction:

The mobile interface is functional, allowing users to initiate connections, send audio, and receive responses.
Screenshot capture functionality is integrated but the handling on the server side needs further enhancement. 2. Pending Improvements
Wake Word and Continuous Listening:

Placeholder for wake word detection is in place. Need to integrate an actual wake word detection mechanism for hands-free interaction.
Refine silence detection and handling to ensure robust and efficient operation.
Error Handling and Robustness:

Enhance error handling for various network and processing scenarios to ensure smooth user experience.
Implement retry mechanisms and backoff strategies for WebSocket reconnections.
Frontend Enhancements:

Improve UI components and transitions for a more polished user experience.
Integrate advanced features like wake word handling directly into the mobile interface.
Next Steps

1. Enhance Wake Word and Continuous Listening
   Integrate Wake Word Detection:

Implement a wake word detection service or library for the mobile app and watch interface.
Refine Continuous Listening:

Enhance the current silence detection algorithm to improve accuracy and responsiveness. 2. Improve UI and UX
Polish Mobile Interface:

Refine the design and usability of the mobile app to make it more intuitive and responsive.
Test on various devices to ensure compatibility and performance.
Add Watch Interface:

Develop and test a simplified interface for smartwatches to complement the mobile app. 3. Robust Error Handling
Implement Retry Logic:

Add retry mechanisms and exponential backoff for WebSocket connections to handle network interruptions gracefully.
Improve Logging and Monitoring:

Enhance logging on both frontend and backend to capture errors and performance metrics. 4. Backend Enhancements
Optimize Server Performance:

Review and optimize the WebSocket server and interpreter integration for better performance and scalability.
Enhance Screenshot Handling:

Implement processing and handling of screenshots on the backend to utilize them effectively for context in LLM queries. 5. Testing and Deployment
Testing:

Conduct thorough testing across various devices and network conditions to ensure robustness and reliability.
Perform user testing to gather feedback and improve usability.
Deployment:

Prepare the application for deployment, including setting up hosting for the backend server and app distribution for mobile platforms.
